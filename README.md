Amazon.com Katalon Studio Test Automation Project
This project contains automated software tests for the Amazon.com website using Katalon Studio.

What's Included:

Test Scripts: Katalon Studio test case files (.testCase) that automate various functionalities of the Amazon.com website.
Object Repository (Optional): A centralized repository containing reusable object identifiers used in the test scripts (if applicable).
Test Data (Optional): Sample data files (CSV, Excel, etc.) used to parameterize test cases (if applicable).
Reports: Katalon Studio generated test reports (HTML, PDF, etc.) summarizing test execution results (may be generated after running the tests).
Prerequisites:

Katalon Studio (https://www.katalon.com/download/)
(Optional) Basic familiarity with Katalon Studio and web automation testing concepts.
Running the Tests:

Import Project: Open Katalon Studio and import this project (File -> Import -> Project).
Review Test Cases: Open and review the test case files (.testCase) to understand the functionalities being tested.
Configure Settings (Optional): If necessary, modify settings in Katalon Studio's project settings or environment variables to adjust test execution behavior.
Run Tests: Execute the test cases individually or use Katalon Studio's built-in test suite functionality to run multiple tests in sequence.
Understanding Test Results:

Katalon Studio will generate test reports (HTML, PDF, etc.) upon test execution.
These reports provide details on test execution status (pass/fail), execution time, captured screenshots, and logs.
Analyze the reports to identify any test failures and investigate the root causes.
